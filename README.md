# -Machine-Learning---Linear-Regression-Model-Builder

This program builds the best possible regression model for a given case, by just being provided the data source (file) and target. Among all types of linear models (simple, multiple, polynomial, multi-dimensional) it will build the best one (based upon their calculated scores), choosing automatically the most suitable order and features for it. At the end, the program also tries to improve the model by refining it with Ridge Regression, even if it is just by a little percentage.
