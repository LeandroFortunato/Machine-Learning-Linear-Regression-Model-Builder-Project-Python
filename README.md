# Optimal-Model-Builder

It builds the best possible regression model based on only data source (input file) and the user informed target. Among all types of linear models (simple, multiple, polynomial, multi-dimensional) it will build the best one (based upon their calculated scores), choosing automatically the most suitable order and features for it. At the end, the program also tries to improve the model by refining it with Ridge Regression, even if it is just by a little percentage.
